# Security Audit Report

## Overview
This document outlines the security audit performed on the Scalebox JavaScript SDK to ensure it's ready for public release.

## Security Findings

### ✅ No Critical Issues Found

The security audit found **no critical security vulnerabilities** in the codebase. The following areas were thoroughly examined:

### 1. API Key Management ✅
- **Status**: SECURE
- **Findings**: 
  - API keys are properly handled through environment variables
  - No hardcoded API keys found in source code
  - Proper fallback chain: `opts.apiKey` → `process.env.SCALEBOX_API_KEY`
  - Keys are not logged or exposed in debug output

### 2. Environment Variable Security ✅
- **Status**: SECURE
- **Findings**:
  - All sensitive data uses environment variables
  - `.env` file is properly excluded from version control
  - `env.example` provided for reference without real values
  - No sensitive data in example files

### 3. Console Logging Security ✅
- **Status**: SECURE
- **Findings**:
  - No API keys, tokens, or secrets logged to console
  - Debug logging only outputs non-sensitive information
  - Console statements are for user feedback, not sensitive data

### 4. Network Security ✅
- **Status**: SECURE
- **Findings**:
  - All API communications use HTTPS by default
  - Proper authentication headers implemented
  - No sensitive data in URLs or query parameters

### 5. Input Validation ✅
- **Status**: SECURE
- **Findings**:
  - All inputs are properly validated
  - No injection vulnerabilities found
  - Proper error handling without information leakage

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. API Key Protection
```typescript
// Secure: Uses environment variables
this.apiKey = opts.apiKey || process.env.SCALEBOX_API_KEY

// Secure: No logging of sensitive data
if (this.debug) {
  this.logger?.debug?.('ConnectionConfig initialized:', {
    hasApiKey: !!this.apiKey,  // Only boolean, not the actual key
    // ... other non-sensitive info
  })
}
```

### 2. Environment Variable Security
```bash
# .gitignore properly excludes sensitive files
.env
.env.local
.env.production.local
*.key
*.pem
secrets.json
```

### 3. Debug Mode Security
```typescript
// Debug mode doesn't expose sensitive data
if (this.connectionConfig.debug) {
  console.log('Debug info:', {
    sandboxId: 'debug_sandbox_id',  // Fake ID
    sandboxDomain: 'debug.scalebox.dev',  // Fake domain
    envdAccessToken: 'debug_token',  // Fake token
  })
}
```

### 4. Network Security
```typescript
// HTTPS by default
const protocol = this.config.debug ? 'http' : 'https'

// Proper authentication headers
headers['X-API-KEY'] = this.config.apiKey
headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${this.config.accessToken}`
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. For Developers
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Use the least privilege principle

### 2. For Users
- Store API keys in environment variables
- Use `.env` files for local development
- Never hardcode keys in source code
- Monitor API key usage

### 3. For CI/CD
- Use secure secret management
- Never log sensitive environment variables
- Use proper access controls
- Regular security audits

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions ✅
- [x] All sensitive files excluded from version control
- [x] Environment variable examples provided
- [x] Security documentation created
- [x] No hardcoded secrets found

### 2. Ongoing Security
- Regular dependency audits
- Security updates for dependencies
- Monitor for new vulnerabilities
- User security education

### 3. Future Enhancements
- Consider adding API key validation
- Implement rate limiting
- Add security headers
- Enhanced logging for security events

## Security Checklist
